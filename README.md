## Improvements

- I feel like improvements can be made to the trending graph to better display the data. A bar graph of the count for each rating could be a clearer way to display the data.
- I would like to improve the current tests. I have mostly included unit/ integration tests for the main features but I feel like these can still be improved.
- It would be good to do some end to end testing and I would look to use a library like cypress
